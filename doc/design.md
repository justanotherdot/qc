# Design Notes

## Features

### Rich value from evaluation

It would be nice to know the results of dice rolls as well as the final
resulting value. That way we could know that the, e.g., first, second, and third
roll such and such a value.

Something along the lines of

```
pub struct Value {
  result: i64,
  rolls: Vec<i64>,
}
```

### Pretty printer

A pretty printer to take a generated AST that produces a final variant would be
helpful for debugging state, as well as just general testing.

### Multiple rolls with integer prefix to die

e.g. `2d8`

### Restrict die ranges.

This would be the common ranges, including 100. Hence: 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 20, 100.

### Division

Must cast to float, rather than supporting integer division.

## Testing

Fuzzing against the grammar would be good.

## Builders

The combinators for building the AST could be drastically better to improve
ergonomics of expressing types without relying heavily on the parse logic.

### Snapshots

Make golden files write/read from vec of bytes.
